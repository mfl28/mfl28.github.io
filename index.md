I am a graduate of a mathematics Master's program at Graz University of Technology in Austria, where I enjoyed solving 
hard problems in the fields of numerical mathematics, mechanics and mathematical modeling. In my thesis, I worked on the analysis and C++ implementation of adaptive numerical solution methods for partial differential equations.

My goal and passion is the combination of my mathematical knowledge and analytic thinking skills with modern software engineering practices and programming techniques in order to create software that is helpful to people. 

I love programming, doing Machine Learning (and Deep Learning) projects and automating stuff. I primarily see myself as a problem solver and to be an effective problem solver it is important to me to know the right tools and keep up with the latest developments and research in a broad field of tech. 
Therefore, I am constantly expanding my knowledge by working on projects, reading books and papers, doing online courses and listening to programming related podcasts.

Feel free to check out some of my [projects](/projects).
